# KOS Engine

### Why make a game engine?
- I found I do not like working within a box such as unreal engine and unity. There are others out there with more controll given to the users but whats the fun in that? Its like a little tease to what you could have. So I wanted to make a game engine. I also like hurting myself and this is safe.

### Goal
- Create a Vulkan game engine that uses the Windows API and supports apple and liunx
